# Console Finances

## Description

My motivation for this project was to creat Javascript code to analyse the financial records of a given company. I built this project to make it more assessible and easier for the company to analyse their financial records. In doing so it will save time for the users, as the financial dataset doesnt need to be analyse manually it adds a more efficient way of working.
